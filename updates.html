                    <p>Today, I found the motivation to start the first game that will be released on this website.  It is a first person shooter where you are on a planet far out in space with either aliens or other players as enemies(I haven't decided which would be cooler).  Anyway, I have unique ideas for the weapons and damage system that I am excited to try and add to this game.</p>
                    <p>I started progress late in the day, but got some good work done in a few hours.  Currently, there is a pill with a brick that can shoot balls.  While it may not sound like much, the movement and shooting systems are some of the most difficult and key parts of this game, so it's a good way to start.  I'll be able to provide images and videos of this project once I get a few more things done.</p>
                    <p>As for the website, get used to how it is right now.  I plan to update it once I'm done with this project.  Things I'm currently looking at adding include and easier way for me to edit this updates page(I have to edit the file every time), and a newsletter system.</p>

                    <p>Welcome to the updates page of my portfolio.  Here, I will provide updates on projects I am working on.  Currently, my project is this website, so let me show you what I've gotten done here.</p>
                    <p>First, we need to talk about the navigation bar up top, one of the most simple yet most important parts of the website.  By clicking my name, you can see the homepage.  And if you've found this page, then I'm assuming you can figure out how the rest of the buttons work.  On this page, I can create as many articles as I want.  I spent hours arguing with ChatGPT to get the correct design fo this page, so take a little time to apreciate it.  To the right, there is a very nice table of contents created for your ease.  To use it, simple click on any article you want to review, and a javascript function will take you on down there.  Go ahead, try it out.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- First Article -->
            <div class="update-content" id="update1">
                <div class="update-title">My Portfolio</div>
                <div class="update-date">December 30th, 2023</div>
                <div class="update-text">
                    <p>I use an html online editor to see live changes to my page, and let me tell you, it is looking so good right now.  Better than anything I even thought of.  Hopefully I can continue to surpass my own expectations in future projects.  This is my first time seriously using html, and I can't take all the credit.  I used ChatGPT to create most of this.  Turns out, you just have to tell the little robot what you want and he'll create it for you.  AI is definatly going to have a huge impact on coding.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, I created this portfolio to help me keep up and stay motivated through projects.  I promise to post all my finalized projects in the projects tab, and keep you all up to date on anything I'm working on here in updates.  While the homepage may look bland now, I assure you I'll lighten it up once I get a project done.  By the way, most of my projects will be games that you can play in the browser, and if your school doesn't block this website, thank me later.</p>
